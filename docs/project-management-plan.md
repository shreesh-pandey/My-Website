### GitHub as a Project Management Tool (Integrated in All Phases)

GitHub will be used to simulate real-world project management workflows:

- **Repositories:** Organized with structured folders for assets, source files, and documentation.
- **Branches:** Used for separating features and bug fixes. PM tracks changes and manages branch strategy.
- **Issues:** Used to create, assign, and track tasks or bugs.
- **Milestones:** Define key phases (e.g., Phase 1: Template Review Completion) and group related issues.
- **Projects (Kanban Boards):** Organize tasks under To Do, In Progress, and Done columns for visual tracking.
- **Pull Requests:** Used to simulate code reviews and controlled merging of features into main branch.
- **Discussions & Comments:** Used for communication, updates, and decisions.
- **Releases:** Version control for major deliverables.
- **Commit Messages:** Follow a uniform format for clarity:
  - **Commit message**
  - **Description.**
- **Optional Learning Tags:** Add tags like `#PM-Lesson`, `#GitHubUsage`, etc., to commit messages or logs to track project management insights.

This practical, phased approach will help you build strong project management skills alongside completing your website project.
